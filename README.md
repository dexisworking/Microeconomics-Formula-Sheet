## 1. Utility Concepts
- **Total Utility (TU):**  
  \[
  TU_n = U_1 + U_2 + U_3 + \ldots + U_n
  \]  
  Where \( TU_n \) is the total utility derived from \( n \) units of a commodity.

- **Marginal Utility (MU):**  
  \[
  MU_n = TU_n - TU_{n-1}
  \]  
  Where \( MU_n \) is the additional utility from consuming the \( n^{th} \) unit.

---

## 2. Demand and Supply
- **Demand Function:**  
  \[
  Q_d = a - bP
  \]  
  Where:  
  \( Q_d \) = quantity demanded,  
  \( P \) = price,  
  \( a \) = intercept,  
  \( b \) = slope.

- **Market Demand:**  
  \[
  Q_d^M = Q_d^H + Q_d^K
  \]  
  Where \( Q_d^M \) is the total market demand, \( Q_d^H \) is Helen's demand, and \( Q_d^K \) is Kelly's demand.

- **Supply Function:**  
  \[
  Q_s = c + dP
  \]  
  Where:  
  \( Q_s \) = quantity supplied,  
  \( P \) = price,  
  \( c \) = intercept,  
  \( d \) = slope.

- **Market Supply:**  
  \[
  Q_s^M = Q_s^C + Q_s^S
  \]  
  Where \( Q_s^M \) is the total market supply, \( Q_s^C \) is Cadbury's supply, and \( Q_s^S \) is Starbucks' supply.

---

## 3. Price Elasticity of Demand
- **Price Elasticity of Demand (\( E_d \)):**  
  \[
  E_d = \frac{\%\ \text{Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\%\ \text{Change in Price}}
  \]

---

## 4. Consumer Choice
- **Budget Constraint:**  
  \[
  p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 \leq m
  \]  
  Where:  
  \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \) = prices of goods \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \),  
  \( m \) = consumer's income.

- **Optimal Choice Condition:**  
  \[
  MRS_{x_1x_2} = \frac{P_1}{P_2}
  \]  
  Where \( MRS_{x_1x_2} \) is the marginal rate of substitution between goods \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).

---

## 5. Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
- **Opportunity Cost:**  
  \[
  \text{Opportunity Cost} = \frac{\text{Change in Good A}}{\text{Change in Good B}}
  \]

---

## 6. Taxation
- **Tax Revenue:**  
  \[
  \text{Tax Revenue} = T \times Q
  \]  
  Where \( T \) is the tax per unit and \( Q \) is the quantity sold.

---

## 7. Market Equilibrium
- **Equilibrium Condition:**  
  \[
  Q_d = Q_s
  \]  
  Where \( Q_d \) is the quantity demanded and \( Q_s \) is the quantity supplied.

---

## 8. Shifts in Demand and Supply Curves
- **Demand Curve Shifters:**
  - Number of buyers  
  - Income (Normal vs. Inferior goods)  
  - Prices of related goods (Substitutes and Complements)  
  - Tastes and preferences  
  - Expectations  
  - Climatic conditions  

- **Supply Curve Shifters:**
  - Input prices  
  - Technology  
  - Number of sellers  
  - Price expectations
